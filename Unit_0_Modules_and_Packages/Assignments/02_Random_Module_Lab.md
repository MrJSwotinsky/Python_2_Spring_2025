# Unit 0, Assignment 02: Random Module Lab
Due: Friday, January 31st 2025

## Reading
[edube.org](edube.org) (1.2.1.1 Useful Modules AND 1.2.1.5 Useful Modules | random - 1.2.1.8 Useful Modules | random)<br><br>

## Assignmment
1. Create a new Python file in your in your `Python_2_Unit_0_Assignments_and_Labs` folder titled `LastNameFirstInitial_Random_Module_Lab.py`.
2. Copy/Paste the starter code below, replace `Full_Name` with your full name, and complete the lab below.


```python
# Random Module Lab
# Full_Name

print('')
# Write you code for step 3 below:


```
## Lab
1. Import the random module.
2. Write a line of code to display the contents of the entities contained within the `random` module.
3. Write a for loop to generate and display 5 random floats between between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
4. Add a line of code within your for loop to set the seed to a number of your choosing.
5. Comment out the line of code that sets a random seed within your for loop, and replace it with a line of code that sets a random seed before your for loop. 

10. At the bottom of your code, use comments to respond to the following questions and prompts:
     * What import strategy must be used in order to be able to display the entities within a module?
     * What must you do to display the entities of a module that has been imported using an alias?
     * In questions 3, 4, and 5 you generated a set of random numbers in a few different ways.  First, you generated random numbers without setting a seed.  Next, you generated a set of random numbers by setting a random seed within a for loop.  Finally, you generated a set of random numbers by settting a random seed before a for loop.  How did the results differ? In your own words, explain what is happening.
