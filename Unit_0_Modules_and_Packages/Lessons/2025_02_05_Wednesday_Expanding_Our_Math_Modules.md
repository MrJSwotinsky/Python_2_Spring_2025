## Expanding Our Math Modules

**AIM:** How can we expand the functionality of our math modules?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT:**
<br><ins>IEC.TYS64T.2</ins>: Apply Basic Programming Concepts (e.g., control flow, data collections, functions, exception-handling) to more complex contexts.
<br><ins>IEC.TYS64T.4</ins>: Write and analyze programs and code segments that utilize built-in and user-defined modules and packages.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can expand my math module to include the following functions:
    * `factorial(n)`
    * `pow(x,y)`
    * `gcd(n,m)`
    * `lcm(n,m)`
    * `floor(x)`
    * `ceil(x)`
      
|DO NOW|
|---|
|Write down a step by step process for finding the GCD (greatest common divisor) of two numbers.|

**AGENDA**
1. GCD Shareout
2. Code Along:
   * `gcd(n,m)`
   * `factorial(n)`
   * `floor(x)`
3. Math Module Project, Part 3

**ASSIGNMENT:** 
<br>[Unit 0 Assignment 05 - Math Module Project, Part 3](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/Python_2_Spring_2025/blob/main/Unit_0_Modules_and_Packages/Assignments/05_My_Math_Module_Project_Part_3.md)

## Resources

**Math Reference**
|Name|Notation|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**factorial**|`factorial(n)`|The factorial of a natural number, n, noted n!, is the product of all numbers from 1 to n.<br><br>For example, 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5.|
|**power**|`pow(x,y)`| A number x, raised to the power of another number, y, noted $x ^ y$, is equal to x multiplied by itself y times.<br><br>For example, $2 ^3$ = 2 * 2 * 2.|
|**GCD<br>(greatest common divisor)**|`gcd(n,m)`| The GCD of two natural numbers, n and m is the greatest natural number that divides evenly into both.<br><br>For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4.|
|**LCM<br>(least common multiple)**|`lcm(n,m)`| The LCM of two natural numbers, n and m is the least natural number that is a multiple of both.<br><br>For example, the LCM of 8 and 12 is 24.|
|**Floor**|`floor(x)`| The floor of a number x is the greatest number that is less than or equal to x.  For example, the floor of 1.5 is 1.|
|**Ceiling**|`ceil(x)`| The ceiling of a number x is the least number that is less than or equal to x.  For example, the ceiling of 1.5 is 2.|
